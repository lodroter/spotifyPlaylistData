# spotifyPlaylistData

Python code for getting playlist data from any Spotify playlist. 

# Setup 

First you need to copy link to any spotify playlist like this 

https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5erJSy4v4m2LmTxsgwi8dy?si=149fa7ec74654ec5

For playlist id we need only this part of the link 

5erJSy4v4m2LmTxsgwi8dy

For credentials you need to create Spotify an app in spotify dashboard 

https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard

In settings of this app you can find ClientID and ClientSecret which you need to copy into the code. 

Once you've changed these 3 things you can run the code and the csv file will be created.
